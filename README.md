# CabEZ
A Cab booking app for the Elderly


This was an experimental project to see how streamlined can the bab booking process can become if designed properly.

This was obviously made by keeping elderly people in mind since they are the ones who has the problems with the usage of Technology in general

I'd say this was a fairly simple coding problem and required a lot of implementation of HCI Principles.
